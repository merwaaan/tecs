Core
====

  - Bind Components with their Options
    (right now, it's possible to do createEntity(CTransform, CSquareOptions)...)

  - Notify about dependencies between components
    (eg. CAnimated is useless without CSprite
         CSprite is useless without CTransform
         ...)

Extra components
================

Motion:
  - Move along complex trajectories
    (waypoints could be entities with a special component?)

Rendering:
  - Layered, for z-ordering drawable entities

Physics:
  - Physics system
  - Physics component
  - Collision callbacks (how to handle that cleanly?)

Input:
  - Basic keyboard controller
  - Basic mouse controller
